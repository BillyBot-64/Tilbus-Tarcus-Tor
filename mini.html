<p><b>Strategically place your own pieces on any unoccupied square. Get in 3 in a row to win. If you win first, you are in 1st place and out of the game. The game is over once the 2nd player wins (whoever did not get a row will get 3rd), or when all squares become occupied (there will be a draw between 2 or all players). <br><br>This is a 3 player game.<br>The order goes: Sad face -> Hammer and Sickle -> Triangle<br><br>If you see the & symbol, then those two players both drew.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>What?
